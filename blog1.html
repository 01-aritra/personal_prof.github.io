					<h2>Attack on Hindues</h2>
					<p class="meta">Posted on April 3, 2023 by Aritra Mishra</p>

				<p> The Hindu community has been the target of various attacks in different parts of the world. These attacks have been fueled by various factors including religious intolerance, political ideology, and economic interests. Hindus, who are one of the oldest and most peaceful communities in the world, have been subjected to violence, discrimination, and persecution for centuries.

One of the most significant attacks on Hindus in recent years was the 2002 Gujarat riots in India. The riots were triggered by the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims, resulting in the deaths of over 50 people. In the ensuing violence, thousands of people were killed, and many more were injured. The Gujarat riots were a tragic reminder of the deep-seated religious tensions in India, and the need for greater communal harmony.

The persecution of Hindus is not limited to India alone. In neighboring Pakistan, Hindus have faced discrimination and violence for decades. The forced conversion of Hindu girls and women has been a major issue in Pakistan, with reports suggesting that hundreds of Hindu girls are abducted and forcibly married off to Muslim men every year. Hindu temples and properties have also been targeted by extremist groups, with the authorities turning a blind eye to these atrocities.

In Bangladesh, Hindus have also been subjected to violence and persecution. The country has seen a rise in attacks on Hindus, with many of these attacks being carried out by Islamic extremists. Hindu temples have been vandalized, and many Hindu families have been forced to flee their homes due to threats and intimidation.

The attacks on Hindus are not limited to South Asia alone. In Malaysia, the government has been accused of discriminating against the Hindu community. The government has been accused of demolishing Hindu temples and restricting the use of Hindu symbols and practices. In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, Hindus have also been subjected to violence and discrimination. In 2018, a mob attacked a group of Hindu pilgrims, killing one person and injuring several others.

The attacks on Hindus are a tragic reminder of the need for greater religious tolerance and understanding in the world. The Hindu community, like any other community, deserves the right to practice their religion freely and without fear of persecution. Governments and civil society organizations must work together to promote greater communal harmony and prevent the kind of violence and discrimination that has been inflicted on the Hindu community.

In conclusion, the attacks on Hindus in various parts of the world are a cause for concern. The international community must take note of these atrocities and work towards promoting greater religious tolerance and understanding. The Hindu community, like any other community, deserves the right to live in peace and security, and it is up to all of us to ensure that this right is protected.</p>
