					<h2>Howrah attack on hindu</h2>
					<p class="meta">Posted on April 5, 2023 by Aritra Mishra</p>
				</header>
				<p>The situation in Howrah district's Kazipara area, which witnessed clashes between two groups during a procession on Ram Navami, is peaceful and under control on Saturday, even as prohibitory order was still in force in the area, an officer said.

					Shops and markets opened as traffic movement started from the morning amid heavy deployment of police in the area, the officer said.
					
					Internet connections remained suspended even as prohibitory order under CrPC Section 144 was still in place in and around the area where several shops and residences were vandalised during the clashes, he said.
					
					The state CID has over the investigation of the clashes, the officer said.
					
					Meanwhile, police continued with raids throughout the intervening Friday-Saturday night and nabbed a few more people for their alleged involvement in the vandalism.</p>
